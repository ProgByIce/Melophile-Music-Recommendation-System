# Melophile-Music-Recommendation-System

## The Story
This project explores a music enthusiast’s deep interest for the complex nature of music recommendation algorithms – the way in which music streaming platforms like Spotify understand a user’s music taste well enough to provide them with consistent and relevant music recommendations.

Currently, giants in the music streaming market such as Spotify offer vast feature sets and impressive recommendation algorithms, however, the apps provide little explicit control over recommendation techniques and share minimal insight into what’s going on behind the scenes. Melophile is an app built in response to these shortcomings – an app built to provide the user with utmost control and customizability over music recommendation and playlist generation. 

Through this project, I set myself the ambitious task of building a recommendation algorithm from scratch. My algorithm works based on content-based filtering, which uses similarities in song metadata and audio features to make relevant song suggestions. This recommendation algorithm is employed to support features like raw playlist generation and playlist enhancement. The app employs algorithms such as cosine similarity, k-means clustering, and silhouette analysis to perform music recommendation.
